Anodyne
=======

Yet another framework for creating scalable applications with rich domain model and NoSQL.

It is designed to be highly pluggable and super-easy to use due to intensive use of DSL (fluent interfaces).
And if you're into F# (and functional programming in general) you can get some special comforts like Option, memoized functions, etc.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/Kostassoid/Anodyne/wiki) for more details.
