        <h3>What is Anodyne?</h3>

<p>Anodyne is a framework for .NET for developing fast, scalable and testable distributed systems (including web apps) with rich domain model and NoSQL database as a persistence storage.</p>

<p>It's highly pluggable, extremely flexible and allows to eliminate most of the usual boilerplate code.</p>

<p>One of the priorities of the framework is producing intention-revealing code by using industry standard design patterns and utilizing fluent interfaces (DSLs).</p>

<p>Some example configuration could look like this:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
public override void OnConfigure(INodeConfigurator c)
{
    c.UseWindsorContainer();
    c.UseWindsorWcfProxyFactory();
    c.UseMongoDataAccess(Configured.From.AppSettings("DatabaseServer", "DatabaseName"))
        .AsDomainStorage();

    c.OnStartupPerform<DataAccessConfiguration>();
    c.OnStartupPerform<WcfServicesRegistration>();
}
{% endhighlight %}
